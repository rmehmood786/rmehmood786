## Hi there 👋, I'm Rashid Mehmood

I'm a **Researcher & AI Enthusiast** with a Master's in **Cybersecurity & Artificial Intelligence** from the University of Sheffield. Currently, I’m working as a **Research Assistant** at Liverpool John Moores University, focusing on **gait analysis, human motion studies, and AI for health & safety applications**.  

I love applying **machine learning, time-series analysis, and generative AI** to solve real-world problems, especially in health, safety, and ageing.

### 🔭 Current Work
- Research Assistant at **Liverpool John Moores University**:  
  - Developing algorithms for **gait phase segmentation** and **biomechanical transition detection**.  
  - Applying **Generative AI** for motion pattern analysis in digital health applications.  
  - Preparing a manuscript: *Gait Phase Identification and Feature Extraction* (2025).

## How I can help
- Batch pipelines: video → events → annotated MP4 + Excel/plots
- Pose series cleaning (gaps, outliers, smoothing, normalization)
- Research support: reproducible scripts, figure generation
